# Kafka ‚≠ê
- Messaging Queue used for distributed systems, widely used for event streaming and for applications at scale.
- https://kafka.apache.org/

## How
- There are several interfaces that enable you to interact with Kafka. Landoop and WurstMeister are a couple of them
### Landoop
- Docker
```shell
docker run --rm -it  -p 2181:2181 -p 3030:3030 -p 8081:8081 -p 8082:8082 -p 8083:8083 -p 9092:9092 -e ADV_HOST=192.168.99.100 -name kafka-dev landoop/fast-data-dev

kafka-topics --create --topic first-topic --zookeeper 192.168.99.100:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 3
```
- Dockerfile
```Dockerfile
FROM landoop/fast-data-dev:latest

ENV ADV_HOST=127.0.0.1

EXPOSE 2181
EXPOSE 8081
EXPOSE 8082
EXPOSE 8083
EXPOSE 9092
EXPOSE 3030
```
### WurstMesiter
- docker
```yml
version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: wurstmeister/zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
  kafka:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 192.168.99.100
      KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS: "first_topic:3:2"
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
  kafka_2:
    image: wurstmeister/kafka
    ports:
      - "9093:9092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME: 192.168.99.100
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
```



## Commands 
### List Brokers
`docker exec -ti kafka /usr/bin/broker-list.sh`

### List Topics
`docker exec -ti kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper zookeeper:2181`

### Create a Topic
`docker exec -ti kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper zookeeper:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic test2`

### List Topics
`docker exec -ti kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper zookeeper:2181`


## Notes
- zookeeper - zookeeper is in charge of leader election, and coordinating brokers
- Generally Kafka usually run under a zookeeper, and won't work without one
- Zookeeper makes sure that there is always a leader for the brokers, and monitors them
- Kafka environment:
    - KAFKA_CREATE_TOPICS - creates a topic on startup with this format: <topic_name>:<no_of_partition>:<replication_factor>

- Just by specifying replication factor, and with enough brokers, zookeeper handles the rest. This helps with your application's resiliency as it is not dependent in one messaging broker alone
    - KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT - which zookeeper to connect to
    - KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME - host name/ip

- Second Kafka is named kafka_2, notice that under ports, we use a different port number and that we do note create the topic anymore under environment, but connects to the same zookeeper

### Ensuring Replication is done:
`./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 192.168.99.100:9092 --topic first-topic --from-beginning`

`./kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 192.168.99.100:9093 --topic first-topic --from-beginning`

### NOTES
-  Even if we did not create the topic on the second kafka, we can list out the messages from the 2nd kafka service, this is because we have a replication factor of 2 when we created the topic. Zookeeper is then in charge of picking which kafka broker to replicate the topic to, and since we only have 2 brokers in this instance we can instantly find that the messages are replicated in both brokers.
